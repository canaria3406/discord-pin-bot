# Terms of Service
Effective: July 21, 2024
Last Updated: July 21, 2024

## What You Can Expect from Us
PinBot is a Discord bot that helps users pin messages without needing manage message permission.

## Using the Service
PinBot will NEVER STORE any of your user data, which includes but is not limited to your avatar, description, messages, and pictures sent. When a server administrator adds PinBot to a server, they should read and agree to the terms of service, and fulfill the obligation to notify server members. If a server administrator does not agree to the terms of service, they should immediately cease using PinBot and remove it from the server. When server members use PinBot, they should read and agree to the terms of service. If a server member does not agree to the terms of service, they should immediately cease using PinBot and leave all servers containing PinBot.

## Responsibility
You understand and agree that the server management responsibility lies entirely with the server administrator.

## Settling Disputes
Most disputes can be resolved informally, so if you have an issue with the services, you agree to reach out to us before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. This requires sending @canaria3406 a written description of the dispute, including your name, the nature of your complaint, and how you'd like to resolve it, along with your Discord account ID, to admin#canaria.cc (replace # with @). If there are unresolved issues necessitating litigation, both parties agree that the governing law shall be the laws of Taiwan, and Taiwan Taipei District Court shall serve as the court of first instance.

## Software
PinBot is an open-source project released on GitHub under the MIT license. You can view the source code at https://github.com/canaria3406/discord-pin-bot. You can reproduce this code in any form, but you need to include the GitHub URL of PinBot's source code in the bot's description when publishing the bot on Discord.
